HashiTalks is a 24-hour virtual event produced by the HashiCorp Community Team and is hosted annually on the last Thursday in February. The first HashiTalks was in 2019 and the program continues to grow year-over-year. In 2020 we were able to connect with an audience of over 10,000. The CFP is open to the community for submissions on how they utilize HashiCorp tools, both OSS and ENT, in their workflows.

Confirmed Talks are 30 minutes long, recorded, and available on YouTube and HashiCorp's Resources page soonafter the virtual event and shared throughout the year. HashiTalks speakers are encouraged to submit to the CFP for our in-person conferences: HashiConf and HashiDays. We host speaker enablement sessions and invite all CFP submissions to join and learn from industry leader, Wesley Reisz, on best practices and common "gotchas" in presenting digitally. 

See the project tab for a breakout of all steps and more details in planning HashiTalks. 
Where able, the project plan is agnostic but as this is modeled after HashiTalks, some details are HashiCorp specific and are encouraged to be applied elsewhere.
